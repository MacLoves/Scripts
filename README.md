# Scripts README - 14 Sept 2018
# Will this become https://github.com/MacLoves/Scripts ?  ;)

Hello World!  Greetings and Salutations...

I have primarily worked as a Systems Administrator and network manager,
which would not have been possible if it was not for the collection of scripts
that I wrote to assist me (and in the best cases, fully automate) important
aspects of my responsibilities.

My lifestyle is much slower-paced now than when I worked, and I have found
myself drawn back to installing and configuring robust server environments,
including some very powerful web, database and application servers.

As I looked for new up and coming software projects, trying to find the next
"killer app" (sorry) that I could server on my hardware for my users, my
research just brought me again and again here to GitHub...

I have grown a profound and deep respect for this organization, and all of you
who keep coming back and contributing...   now just to the other users here,
but quite literally to the entire planet and all of Humanity!  

I have worked for several dev companies as the "server guy", so I am very
comfortable with coders at all levels. I've closely partnered with dev teams to
design and install Testing and Production environments that can really blaze!

Now, I am finally learning a little "true" coding, but most likely my main
contribution here will be scripts for the use of my brother and sister Admins,
those denizens of the datacenter, who keep everything running smooth and fast.

I have many years of experience with both Linux and Windows as application
server environments. (Along with a handful of outdated OS's, but who doesn't?)

My commits will mostly be BASH used on my Linux systems (tho hopefully portable)
along with some PowerShell and even good old-fashioned Batch files!

And if, after a long time learning, I actually stumble onto a project and find
something I can contribute there, I will be honored and have all of you to
thank for creating this place, where I have the opportunity to do so!

Thank you & One Love...
